    <p>Solar System ExplorationSpace, in a physical sense, is the vast, three-dimensional expanse that contains the
        positions
        and directions of all objects. It's often considered a boundless four-dimensional continuum with time, known as
        spacetime. Beyond its physical dimensions, space also refers to the vast, near-vacuum expanse beyond Earth's
        atmosphere,
        often called outer space. This region is characterized by extremely low densities of matter and is a
        near-perfect
        vacuum.</p>

    <P>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. In classical physics, physical space
        is
        often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a
        boundless
        four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</P>
