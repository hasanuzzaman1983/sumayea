    <p>A sea beach, also known as a shore or strand, is a landform along the edge of a body of water, typically an ocean
        or
        sea, characterized by loose particles like sand, pebbles, or shells.Sea beaches are renowned for their beauty,
        offering a unique blend of natural elements that create a calming and
        visually stunning environment. The expansive shoreline, the sound of waves, the feel of sand, and the vastness
        of the
        ocean all contribute to a sense of peace and well-being. The beauty is further enhanced by sunsets and sunrises,
        which
        paint the sky with vibrant colors, creating a breathtaking spectacle</p>
