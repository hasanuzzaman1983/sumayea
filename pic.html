    <p> Science is a systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and
        predictions about the universe. It involves observing, experimenting, and analyzing the natural and social world
        through
        a structured methodology based on evidence. Science encompasses various fields of study, including the physical
        sciences
        (like physics, chemistry, and astronomy), biological sciences (like biology and medicine), and social sciences
        like
        anthropology and econo</p>
