        <h3>science</h3>
        <h5>Science encompasses the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world
            through
            observation and experiment, and technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical
            purposes. Oxford
            Reference provides more than 233,000 concise definitions and in-depth, specialist encyclopedic entries on
            the wide range
            of subjects within these broad disciplines.

            Our coverage comprises authoritative, highly accessible information on the very latest terminology,
            concepts, theories,
            techniques, people, and organizations relating to all areas of science and technologyâ€”from astronomy,
            engineering,
            physics, computer science, and mathematics, to life and earth sciences, chemistry, environmental science,
            biology, and
            psychology. Written by trusted experts for researchers at every level, entries are complemented by
            illustrative line
            drawings, equations, and charts wherever useful.

        <h3>science</h3>
        <h5>I wish that everyone understood the scientific method, and in particular the unique importance of the
            controlled
            experiment as a method of scientific discovery. Children should be taught at school what an experiment is
            and why it is
            such a powerful way of discovering the truth. Psychology uses various research methods, but the most
            powerful is
            undoubtedly controlled experimentation, not because it is more objective or precise than other methods, but
            because it
            is uniquely capable of providing evidence of causal effects.</h5>
